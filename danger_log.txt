Danger Log

03/28/2020:
In client.cpp, the message received back by the server contains some unreadable
character at the end. Possibly do not impact scalability but definitely impact 
functionality. Fixed by modifying the recv().
03/30/2020:
For per-request, there's no concurrency at all. Every thread is executed sequentially.
Fixed by change join() to detach().
04/01/2020:
For pre-create, the race condition still happens occasionally.
04/03/2020:
Even after we increased the limit of opened files, the client program still will be
killed or showing "cannot connect the socket" error after executing for a while.
